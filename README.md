# Welcome

Welcome to NETPolynomial wiki! This library is written to provide single and multivariate polynomial representation for .NET framework users. Additionally, it allows its users to evaluate polynomial values, provided that coefficients and indeterminates are defined.

# What can I find in NETPolynomial?

NETPolynomial offers a mechanism of representing and evaluating polynomials using .NET framework. Supported are polynomials consisting of finite number of terms, indeterminates, coefficients and of degrees of limited range (positive and negative).

# Application

One of the possible applications of this library is to aid in machine learning tasks. For example, linear and polynomial regressions require a polynomial of certain degree and coefficients to fit the data. Modelling polynomials (defining terms and adjusting coefficients) using this library should make your like easier.
